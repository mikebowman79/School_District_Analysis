#** School District Analysis**

## Project Overview

The local school board has notified school authorities that evidence has been found that shows evidence of academic hishonesty; reading and math scores
for Thomas High School appear to have been altered. As an effort to show an accurate current analysis, it has been determined that the best course of action 
would be to replace the math and reading scores with NaNs keeping the rest of the scores intact for the other 3 grades of the school.  Once the ninth grade
scores have been nullified, a full school district analysis will be performed and reviewed.

### Summary

After nullification, the analysis of the Thomas High School data shows the following as evidenced by the charts below: 

Overall % Passing Scores: Overall % passing scores decreased from 90.94% to 90.63%
% Passing Reading Scores: Overall % passing scores decreased from 97.308% to 97.018%
% Passing Math Scores:    Overall % passing scores decreased from 93.272% to 93.185%
Average Reading Scores:   Average Reading Scoress improved from 83.848 to 83.896
Average Math Scores:      Average Math Scores decreased from 83.419 to 83.350














### Challenge Summary

As evidenced by the above charts, upon invalidating the 9th grade scores, the Thomas High School scores dropped in the following
categories (as noted above) while Average Reading scores actually improved. 

% Overall Passing
% Passing/Reading
% Passing Math
Average Math Score 

Since the results of these scores have been mixed in terms of increasing or decreasing scores of the overall Thomas High School
scores, it is apparent that a re-testing under strict supervision for the 9th grade class to provide a good comparison and aid
in future analysis.
