# Module 4: 
#** School District Analysis**


## Project Overview
The local school board has notified school authorities that evidence has been found that shows evidence of academic dishonesty; reading and math scores for the Thomas High 9th grade appear to have been altered. As an effort to show an accurate current analysis, it has been determined that the best course of action would be to replace the math and reading scores with NaNs for the 9th grade while keeping the rest of the scores intact for the other 3 grades of the school.  Once the 9th grade scores have been nullified, a full school district analysis will be re-performed and reviewed.


### Summary
After nullification, the analysis of the Thomas High School data shows the following as evidenced by the charts below: 
Overall % Passing Scores: Overall % passing scores decreased from 90.94% to 90.63%
% Passing Reading Scores: Overall % passing scores decreased from 97.308% to 97.018%
% Passing Math Scores:    Overall % passing scores decreased from 93.272% to 93.185%
Average Reading Scores:   Average Reading Scoress improved from 83.848 to 83.896
Average Math Scores:      Average Math Scores decreased from 83.419 to 83.350

### Challenge Summary

As evidenced by the above charts, upon invalidating the 9th grade scores, the Thomas High School scores dropped in the following
categories while Average Reading scores showed improvement. 

% Overall Passing
% Passing/Reading
% Passing Math
Average Math Score 

Since the results of these scores have been mixed in terms of increasing or decreasing scores of the overall Thomas High School
performance, it is apparent that a re-testing under strict supervision for the 9th grade class is required to provide a good comparison and aid
in future school district analysis.
